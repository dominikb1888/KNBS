- Recap:
    - Knowledge Base and Truth Tables:
        - Entailment: One sentence follows from another
        - Completeness: An inference Algorithm is complete, if it can infer any sentence entailed
        - Grounding: Logical Reasoning is connected to reality (open vs. closed world, Models vs. Reality (Figure 7.6))
    - Propositional Logic: Semantics, Knowledge Bases, Simple Inference (i.e., Backtracking Search)

- Propositional Theorem Proofing
    - Logical Equivalence (Figure 7.11)
        - Sentences are true in the same set of models
        - Commutativity, Associativity, Double-negation elimination, Contraposition, Implication Elimination, Biconditional Elimination, DeMorgan, Distributivity

    - Validity: Sentence is true in all models (aka Tautology)
    - Satisfiability: True if sentence satisfied in some model
    - Monotonicity: Set of entailed sentences increases with more knowledge added

    - Forward and Backward Chaining

- Agents based on Propositional Logic
