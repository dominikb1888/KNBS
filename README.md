# Knowledge-based Systems - AI for EPI

Artificial Intelligence will change all processes of life substantially. Understanding the potentials and pitfalls is essential for applying or rejecting AI-based solutions in every situation of your future career. Introductions to AI are usually targeted at Statisticians or Computer Scientist. In this course I would like to lay to teach the conceptual foundations without the low level engineering or math problems associated, while still staying as actionable as possible. Wish us luck :-)

This course is target at Healthcare Professionals with basic skills in an interpreted programming language (R, Python).

Course Goals:
    - Understand and apply the basics of Knowledge representation
    - Enable Specification of Software and AI Needs, Basic Implementation Skills
    - Understand opportunities and limitations of ML and AI in Public Health

## Objectives

A. Knowledge Representation
- Terminologies, Vocabularies and Taxonomies
- Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs
- Linked Data and Knowledge Representation Languages
- Building Knowledge-based Systems

B. Logic, Inference, and Statistical Learning
- Overview on supervised and unsupervised ML methods
- Liner Regression
- Classification
- GAN, Deep Learning
- Generative AI
